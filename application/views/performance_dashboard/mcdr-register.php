									<td>"P&ID (to be located).  Agree vibration is excessive and failure of high pressure components adjacent to walkway is safety hazard. Reassessed as cat 2, 25/08/09 JOMC   
 Rev 1, jomc, Apr 14.Temporary support was put in place, requested for change out to full bracing in yard scope but dropped from scope. Although the WI package has not run for an extended period and this has made it difficult to assess the vibration, the two lines arrowed in image on page 2 should be supported as the vertical movement on the lines transmits into the instrumentation. This may well be sufficient to correct the problem. 
     Rev.2 jomc Nov 13.An effective scaffold support was fitted and was in situ right up to early 2013. A permanent fix needs to be designed and fitted prior to water injection start up, expected Apr 2014.  
Rev.03 J Macdonald 20/07/2014. MCDR now in new format, isometric of lines added, further images added. Mcdr sent to TA for review, comments added. Lines are poorly supported with heavy flanges particularly on the supply line where flanges are 1500lb rating. Movement evident in line with ship roll. Although the WI system has been used infrequently since installation the lines described were prone to vibration and a temporary support was installed by way of scaffolding. This effectively became a permanent but unauthorised fix. An engineered series of supports needs to be installed for ongoing operation within six months. A hand drawn isometric with pipe dimensions between supports and additional images follow. Sent to TA for progression 21/07/14."</td>
