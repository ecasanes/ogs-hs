                                The primary purpose of the iso14224.com website is to improve safety, production efficiency and reduce maintenance costs. It achieves
                                this by fusing knowledge transfer and social validation.

                                Knowledge transfer takes place between assets and operators via the technical bulletin and posts. They are created and distributed by
                                Reliability & Maintenance functions to provides warnings and seek clarifications regarding the cumulative demands of mature operation
                                such as ageing, wear, corrosion, secondary damage and the dilution of skills amongst those with a shared interest.

                                The shared information will enable others to search out similar early warning signs of failure and enables them to introduce mitigating
                                actions through early intervention. It also contributes towards personal development and generates proactive behaviours.

                                The <b>iso14224 standard</b> has been widely used throughout the oil & gas industry since first published in 1999. Enkelt have used the
                                standard to provide the structure and codes for collecting data throughout the website and categorising data stored in our database.
                                Please note that neither Enkelt Ltd. nor our website iso14224.com has a relationship with <a href="www.iso.org">ISO</a>. The following paragraph is a brief

                                equipment in all facilities and operations within the petroleum, natural gas and petrochemical industries during the operational life cycle of
                                equipment. It describes data-collection principles and associated terms and definitions that constitute a "reliability language" that can be
                                useful for communicating operational experience. The failure modes defined in ISO 14224:2006 can be used as a "reliability thesaurus" for
                                various quantitative as well as qualitative applications. ISO 14224:2006 also describes data quality control and assurance practices to
